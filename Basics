First draft and more ideas at the end of the class description.

==== Poisoner ====

A Drow fires an arrow from the shadows and strikes the unwary human interloper. The human takes only two steps after being struck with the arrow before crumbling in a heap on the cavern floor, fast asleep.The Drow quickly drags the sleeping target into the shadows and prepares another ambush.	The new half-elven chef walks out in a huff after the nobleman insulted the quality of his meal. As the noble dies gasping for air an hour later, he wonders why he thought food tasters were an unnecessary expense.	A savage lizardfolk thrusts his spear and just scratches the skin of the mighty Ogre, who suddenly goes berserk, blindly attacking his goblin allies with bestial fury.<br>

====Creating a Poisoner====
	Poisoners use knowledge of poisonous plants, venomous animals, and toxic minerals to craft weapons of war, assassination, and subterfuge. Often the members of criminal organizations or mysterious cults, a poisoner is an expert in the preparation and administering of poisons. She can tailor a toxin to any situation: to paralyse, to knock out, to kill, or even other, more exotic, effects that others would consider beyond the realms of conventional toxicology. Many poisoners pose as apothecaries or herbalists to disguise the deadly truth of their profession. To those who find themselves employing food tasters to protect themselves against possible poison at any time, the threat of a gasping death is very real.<br>

=== Quick Build ===

You can make a Poisoner quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, take the Battle poisoner archetype. Third, choose the Criminal background. Fourth, choose a shortsword, a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows an explorer’s pack, Leather Armor, Alchemist Tools, and a Poisoner’s Kit. Fifth, create two vials of (2) ingredient point wounding poison with the weapon delivery type.

=== Poisonmaking ===
At 1st level, your training in poisons allow you to quickly create custom poisons using your poisoner’s kit. Your knack for poison is represented by a number of Ingredient Points as shown in the Ingredient Points column. <br>
	At the end of a long rest, you expend your ingredient points to create poisons using the Poison Ingredients rules. No poison can use more than two ingredient points. This limit increases as you gain levels in this class as shown in the Features column of the Poisoner table.
The poisons you create cannot be used by anyone but you as are any additional items you create according to your archetype. After 24 hours, any poisons that you have not used lose their potency.
Poison save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier.

=== Poisoner Archetype ===
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that grants you a special style of poisoner abilities:
* Assassin
* Battle poisoner
* Manipulator
Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 5th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

=== Signature Poisons ===
At 1st level, you can create two special poisons worth half your ingredient limit per potion rounded up with one chosen delivery method that you create without the expenditure of any ingredient points. You are considered to have an unlimited supply of vials of these poisons.

=== Poison Tolerance ===
At 2nd level, you gain resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition.

=== Ability Score Increase ===
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

=== Deep sleep ===
Increasing your knowledge about poisons at level 9 you can created a poison, that will put someone in deep sleep and stop most of their bodily functions. The target will inherit all symtopms of the spell Feign Death and if the target was close to its death, death saves are no longer needed every round, but every 10 minutes, starting after the poison was applied.

=== Poison Mastery ===
At 20th level, the Poison save DC = 10 + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier. 



=== Assassin ===

== Hidden specialist ==
Assassins are specialized in hiding their poisons. They gain expertise on Slight of Hand checks for the inject delivery type. All ingredients of the type Sweet and Sleeping cost -2 ingredient points up to a minimum of 1.

== Sneaky beaky ==
At level 5 you have learned to blend into crowds. When disguised, all checks to pierce the disguise are made at a disadvantage and you gain proficiency or if already proficient expertise in stealth and deception.

Ingredients for the Delaying type are free.

== Advanced techniques ==
Once level 10 you learned your way around traps and are now porficient in setting up traps that work like the inject or weapon delivery type. Every attempt to discerne the traps has disadvantage.

You gain expertise in persuasion, desception and intimidation if the target is under influence of one of your poisons with the delaying ingredient. If you already have the antidote is up to you, but you can produce it in 1 minutes without any cost.

== Preperation. Preperation ==

Reaching level 14 you learned that sometimes it is more important to have one single killing blow, then multiple little attacks. You can now produce one poison every long rest, that can use up to double your current ingredient limit.

== Ultimate poison ==

Reaching level 18, the knowledge of deadly poisons of the Assassin has advanced enought that he learned to create a death poison. Once in effect the death poison will decrease the current and maximum hp of its target by 1 every 30 minutes. No healing effects can affect the target and it will die once its hit points reach 0. No death saves are possible. The poison can only be cured by greater restoration or by a medicin check against a DC of 10 + intelligence + 2 * proficiency. Only one death poison can be created per long rest.



=== Battle poisoner ===

== Battle specialist ==

Slayers are specialized in head to head fights. They gain expertise on grapple attacks if using the vapor delivery type. All Ingredients of the type Instant or Wounding cost -2 ingredient points up to a minimum of 1.

== Poisonous Weapon ==

Once you reach the 5th level you learned to infuse one of your weapons with some of your poison. You can change the poison on every long rest, but it can only be Burning, Corrosive, Instant, Lingering or Wounding and up to your proficiency bonus as the number of ingredient points.

Change the dice of the wounding ingredient from a d10 to a d12.

== Poisonous Takedown ==

A Slayer is a master at quickly defeating opponents. At level 10, a Slayer using a poison delivered by the Vapor delivery type gains advantage on the grapple check to administer the poison.

If using a damage inflicting ingredient add your intelligence modifier to the damage.

== Double edged weapon ==

At level 14 the Slyer can utilize both of the edges of his blade for poisoning. He can make an extra attack and have two different poisons on his main weapon. Befor any attack the poisoner has to specify which of the two poisons he uses on the first and second attack. Both poisons can be applied by one weapon delivery type usage.

== Ultimate poison ==

Reaching level 18, the knowledge of damaging poisons of the Slayer has advanced enough that he learned to combine two damaging poisons into the ultimate poison, but because the procedure for such a powerful poison is very difficult a Slayer can only produce two of these poisons per long rest.  




=== Manipulator ===

== Conditions specialist ==
Manipulators are specialized in applying status effects. All Ingredients of the type Amiable, Frenzying and Numbing cost -2 ingredient points up to a minimum of 1. The persistent ingredient cost -1 ingredient point up to a minimum of 1.

You also have trained a companion. This can be any tiny venomous animal like a snake, spider or scorpion. It will follow the simple commands: Move there and attack. Because of a very special diet your companion will inject one of your signature poisons into an attacked target similar to the weapon delivery type. You can change the diet of your pet every long rest to change the applied poison.

== Mix, mix ==
Once level 5 you mastered punching together some ingredients, that somehow do not kill the target but help him instead. You can use your reaction after a successful attack to make some drugs. This drug can be applied to a willing target as a bonus action or a unwilling one with a chosen delivery method except the powder delivery type. This drug has a type which is decided by the highest ability score of the creature that was attacked. If there are two or more ability scores with the same number it is either up to the DM or random which to use. The drug will increase the chosen attribute on the target by half the ability modifier of the attacked creature rounded up. This bonus can exceed the limit of 20 ability score points and lasts for 10 minutes, but if two or more drugs are applied to a creature the creature suffers 1d8 poison damage every round for every excessive drug. The antidote to flush out every bit of drugs is always available for the poisoner.

Only one drug can be produced from an attack up until 1 minute after the attack.

== Multithrow / Multidrug == 
With level 10 you lerned to mix better drugs and you can administer up to two drugs at the same time before the creature suffers damage.

You can make two attacks with the powder delivery type if you chose to use your action for this attack.

== Counterpoison ==

You can compose a drug as an action, that can cure one of the following conditions: Charmed, Blinded, Poisoned, Paralyzed, Sleep, Fear. This drug can be administerd with a bonus action. If the target is willing, no delivery type has to be chosen otherwise follow the rules for the delivery types.

== Ultimate poison ==

It´s simple. You get a poison that petrifies. Once every long rest. No cost what so ever. A creature restrained by this poison must make a Consititution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this poison three times, the posion is resited. If it fails saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

=== More ideas ===

- Another archtype: Magical poisoner
Can channel touch spells into poisons.
Either as half caster or a system similar to the warlock.
Problems I see are that it is too 'gimiky'. It is not another core gameplay mechanic and it will not add to much versatility to the poisons.
I think it will just end in a poisoner, that has two or three additional poisons and thats it. But he has no additional methods of delivery.
Maybe add poisonous mage hand? So he can use his bonus action to use the inject type with his mage hand, but it has to travel back to him and to his target.




- Just use the rogue.
Play it as another archtype for rogue.
Freeze the sneak attack damage at a 2d6 and add fewer ingredient points up from level 3 to balance the damage.
The advantage would be that we wont need any basic class features, because these are not to good any way and some of them
could be fused into the archtypes. Like battle poison rogue or something similar.
I like it because it reduces complexity and will make balance a lot easier.
It kinda favours the assissin class tho, because that is what most rogues would go for on level 1-2 (dex based)
